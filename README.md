# PracticeRepo
A place to learn and make mistakes

This is a really simple code repository with no code. It's sole purpose is to give users a chance to test their machine set up and get 
comfortable with using git and the principles of cloning, pull requests, committing code, merge conflicts, forking, and various outher topics.

It is intended as a safe informal environment that everyone involved feels comfortable and not intimidated. Nothing is wrong, mistakes will not be judged
and learning from trying and experimenting is encoraged.
