# PracticeRepo
A place to learn and make mistakes

This is a really simple code repository with no code. It's sole purpose is to give users a chance to test their machine set up and get 
comfortable with using git and the principles of cloning, pull requests, committing code, merge conflicts, forking, commit comments, and various outher topics.

It is intended as a safe informal environment that everyone involved feels comfortable and not intimidated. Nothing is wrong, mistakes will not be judged
and learning from trying and experimenting is encoraged.

One of the main principles behind setting this repository up is to illustrate 'git flow' and how it works in the real world.

#Structure
The main things to remember is this is really just an example repo, it is intended to be code free, but to explain some of the scenarios that a user may encounter there will be some code elements, mainly psuedo code. It's easy to treat any code you encounter as implemented to demonstrated a specific aspect of code repositorries generally, and how to utilise them in your day to day work life.

There will be various plain text files and readme files in logical folder structures. The structure is set up in a way as to pretty much mimic what you would expect in a real world code repo, a lot of the files and documents are just placeholders and are present to help to get a feel for what to expect in a real project.
